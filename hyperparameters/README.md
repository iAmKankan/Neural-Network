## Fine-Tuning Neural Network Hyperparameters
![dark](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12748752/141935752-90492d2e-7904-4f9f-a5a1-c4e59ddc3a33.png)
**The flexibility of neural networks is also one of their main drawbacks:** there are many hyperparameters to tweak. Not only can you use any imaginable network architecture, but even in a simple MLP you can change the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, the type of activation function to use in each layer, the weight initialization logic, and much more. How do you know what combination of hyperparameters is the best for your task?
