### Bi-Directional RNN or Bi-LSTM

* Simply this is a **bi- directional RNN** using **LSTM**, _rather than the usual **RNN_**. 
* These **might be deep** or **not deep** **really does not matter**.
* Now these are for tasks that actually are **sequential** but the _sequence can go both backward and forward_ that is not only does the future depend on the past, so to speak but the past also depends on the future. 

#### Example #1
Now, what would be an example of that let me give you a very-very simple example though you can think of several thing even in an engineering problems. I will come back to that, so suppose I write something of this sort and you have a optical character recognition tool which basically means this is handwritten and just like we saw with Mnist you want to recognize a handwritten digit.
