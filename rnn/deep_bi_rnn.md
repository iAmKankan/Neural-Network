The **deep RNNs** are particularly important in **language processing** especially language translation. Now, what are deep RNNs let us look at just one of these if I look at one of these within the RNN it is just an ANN as we saw with normal RNNs. In a normal RNN all you had was one input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer. In a deep RNN all you do is that one single layer of the RNN actually become a deep neural network that is the only difference between a deep RNN and a normal RNN.
