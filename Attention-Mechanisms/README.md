The optic nerve of a primate’s visual system receives massive sensory input, far exceeding what the brain can fully process. Fortunately, not all stimuli are created equal. Focalization and concentration of consciousness have enabled primates to direct attention to objects of interest, such as preys and predators, in the complex visual environment. The ability of paying attention to only a small fraction of the information has evolutionary significance, allowing human beings to live and succeed.
### Attention Cues in Biology
To explain how our attention is deployed in the visual world, a two-component framework has emerged and been pervasive. This idea dates back to William James in the 1890s, who is considered the “father of American psychology”. In this framework, subjects selectively direct the spotlight of attention using both the **_nonvolitional_** cue and **_volitional_** cue.
