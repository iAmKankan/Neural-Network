In deep learning, we often use **CNNs** or **RNNs** to encode a sequence. Now with attention mechanisms, imagine that we feed a sequence of tokens into attention pooling so that the same set of tokens act as queries, keys, and values. Specifically, each query attends to all the key-value pairs and generates one attention output. Since the queries, keys, and values come from the same place, this performs self-attention, which is also called intra-attention. In this section, we will discuss sequence encoding using self-attention, including using additional information for the sequence order.
