So, what we are saying is we are taking two different parameters or two different attributes, one is the age of the individual and other one is the monthly income. You will find that the monthly income of an individual has a wide range. For example, the individualâ€™s monthly income may vary from say something like 10,000 rupees a month to even 10 lakhs rupees a month. So, the variation in monthly income is very large whereas, if you consider the age of an adult I mean the age at which a loan can be approved that may vary from say 18 years to may be 100 years. I mean it is very, very optimistic that if we assume that a person lives beyond 100 years of age. So, considering just these two attributes, you will find that one attribute has a very small range, very narrow range from 18 years to approximately it is a 100 years or it may be slightly this side or that side. Whereas, the other attribute which is monthly income that has a wide range may vary from say 10,000 rupees a month to say even 10 lakh rupees a month or may be this side or that side. So, as a result of this considering just these two parameters, if the bank decides that what is the amount of loan or the what is the tenure of loan that can be sanctioned to an individual you will find that because this monthly income has a wide range in most of the cases, the decision will be biased by the attribute which is monthly income because this is many times larger than the other attribute which is age. So, because in most of the time that your decision is going to be biased by an attribute whose values are very large or the range is very large compared to the values and range of other attributes. So, in order to make your decision unbiased you need some sort of normalization techniques.
