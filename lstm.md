* Due to the transformations that the data goes through when traversing an RNN, some information is lost at each time step. 
* After a while, the RNN’s state contains virtually no trace of the first inputs. 
* To tackle this problem, Let’s first look at the most popular of these long-term memory cells: the LSTM cell.
